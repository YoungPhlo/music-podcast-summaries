You are now listening to the Creative Juice podcast brought to you by IndiePreneur.io. What's up Indies? Welcome back to the Creative Juice podcast. This is episode 283. I know, crazy right? Crazy. This is episode 283 and we're gonna be getting into some of the differences between how labels market and how we as Indies market and when it's appropriate to mix and match those two sort of marketing philosophies. I'm your host Jack McCarthy. With me as always is my awesome co-host, Cirque. Cirque, what's up dude? Not a whole lot dude. I'm actually very excited to get into this today and yeah. I'm excited as well. Last week we had Andy Hunter, our Indie X strategist and lead guitarist of As December Falls on the show and we sort of scratched the surface of this topic of the way that labels market and press and PR and direct response and you brought this topic to the topic pool for the show to talk about like okay well like when is it appropriate to market like a label? How do you do it? When is it appropriate? And I think this will be a fun one to explore because we've seen this kind of transition happen a number of times over the years with some of our clients at the agency and some of our sort of core community members and team members and so I'm excited to get into it to see like where is a tipping point? Where does it make sense to pull at some of the strategies that labels use? When does big brand awareness make sense? And I think that we we both probably have some unique perspectives to share on this so I'm psyched. Yeah, hell yeah. I'm very psyched. Yeah I kind of want to start off at the top here and just you know speak to any indie artists who might be listening and just identify sort of a key pain point or a key misstep that I think all of us have made and this is universal across all types of businesses so it's not just for indie artists it's for small businesses too and I know having been you know a serial entrepreneur out of college that like it's easy to make this mistake. Most small businesses when they start up they take their cues from large businesses in terms of how to grow, how to market and as it turns out that the style of promotion and marketing that very large businesses use is entirely inappropriate for a startup or a brand new business where the goal should be to acquire customers rapidly at a discount to grow the revenue while also growing the amount of people who are willing to transact with that business and instead you know sort of the if you look around at the business landscape and you decide like I'm gonna just copy what Coca-Cola is doing or Tide's doing or you know grocery store chain is doing or a fast food chain is doing you end up with some very inappropriate expensive forms of marketing and advertising that really are not going to drive sales for a small business in the way that they would for a large business and the same thing happens with indie artists we look to you know the the megastars of the music industry and look at how they came up and try to glean what we can and then try to sort of replicate that and and it's just the incumbents and the way that they market is inappropriate for smaller artists same for small businesses yeah it's a it's a good starting point for us to kick this off with because it's especially rampant in music because you know you know restaurant a in your town and restaurant B you know they may not look to Olive Garden to for inspiration it's more likely that artists who are dreaming up how to get their music out to the masses are way more likely to look at their favorite huge artist as inspiration right from the jump and so and that's a you know a very normal trap to fall into it's it's very easy to get stuck in it as well it's it's not always easy to pull yourself out of it unless you know which direction to go yeah I think it's what contributes to such a large failure rate for every artist who tries you know you look back through the career of your favorite artists and all you can really identify is like key relationships they were discovered by this manager this label and and then you know everything was hunky-dory from there on out and what you don't see is the many many artists who had a similar story up until that point but it didn't work out and this is sort of the key thesis of our business and our movement is like direct response marketing is not obvious or familiar to most people which is I'm gonna get my message out there to an audience of strangers it's gonna be tied around a very specific offer it's going to be tied around something you can do right now and you might be familiar with these like in a coupon book when you're clipping coupons like it's a form of marketing they're advertising something to you think about Groupon yeah things like that take it into the online sphere you know yeah where the goal is like we're putting this message in front of people but the end result the action that they should take is very specifics claim this specific offer and sort of direct response evolves out from there we're not gonna go into it all this episode but it's ultimately based around a series of offers you have your your you have traffic conversion and return paths so you have a way to get people's attention and put a message in front of them you have an offer you're trying to make them and you have a way to get back in front of them if they take that offer or if they don't take it that's different so I can talk to just the people who took offer a and give them offer B or I can talk to the people who didn't take offer a and not the people who took it and offer them something else so that's sort of like a simplified version of direct response it's supposed to elicit a direct response it's supposed to respond in a specific way to the to the messaging to the marketing and there's always a way to communicate with those who take whatever offers and what it what it unlocks what it makes possible as opposed to sort of branding or large-scale mass marketing is it unlocks the ability to very specifically track and communicate with an audience and you can very specifically know how many people have taken offer a how many people are right for offer B and so that allows you to get very mathematical and precise and not waste money whereas if you were to go run first of all advertisements are very expensive to produce on a large scale so if you go in mass media and television commercial radio commercial ladies are expensive to produce the ad space the the ads themselves are expensive to buy and if no one's ever heard of your brand before and you don't have a whole lot of economies of scale or infrastructure built in going out and advertising that like your brand is like energy or whatever is not going to elicit a very fast response it's not going to get people to go claim your offers so when you're just starting out your goal is to acquire customers at a cost that's cheaper than the revenue those customers bring in and the best way to do that is with direct response same for small businesses same for small artists I think we firmly believe now that this is the right path for smaller artists to take until they get to a point where more mass forms of marketing makes sense for sure yeah and I think that's a helpful way of boiling down or outlining what direct response is in in three very specific and nice neat tidy boxes you know kind of give a zoomed out little view of what direct response can do and just to give you guys a touch point like a real-world touch point in case like branding is the idea of mass market or brand marketing is lost on you here's an example I actually just saw a meme about this before we started recording this episode think back to the 90s and the got milk commercials they weren't promoting a brand of milk they weren't promoting a type of you know a milk product like a muscle milk or something like that they weren't promoting a sale on milk that week no there weren't even there was no sale they weren't promoting like you know milk cartons that you could take to school with you or giant gallons that you could use for cooking purposes or whatever people drink giant gallons of milk for I don't know I don't drink milk they were just the idea of milk and that was a big brand awareness campaign that went on for man probably a decade right if not more yeah yeah yeah it's it's a great example too because what's great about the got milk campaigns or just any form of branding campaign is that they do not I'll backtrack what's great about direct response is it always I like that you went I like that you went from what's great about branding to like hold on what's great about direct response what's great about direct response is it is intended to only direct the audience to the next step the absolute next step okay so whatever the next step is for them that's what it's supposed to get them to do and every campaign is isolated in that way it's not supposed to say well you know you might be here and so you would take this step but if not and you're here take this step it's about you are here here's the next step it's very specific the logical next thing that you should do yeah so let's say you got you know in your business you got offer a offer B and offer C and they're priced in that order right and and then before that maybe got something free you give away to get you know gain people's trust and show them what you can do so you got your free thing you know it's time to go to that next step so the next step for anyone who doesn't know who you are is that free thing once they're there the next step is offer a then offer B and you know if you got a hundred people in your business hundred customers that are somewhere in that chain it's very easy to identify and then tell them where to go but maybe some people skipped offer a and went right to offer B and so now you're getting a little bit more complex now you have people who you know they might be right for one or more offers and you don't really know and then you might have many many more offers than we just went over in your business you might have many many more ways for them to take that offer and once it starts scaling up like that you get a combinatorial explosion is what it's called so it's when what it's when the parts become too many to count and you can't really identify and direct people or it's not profitable to do so to identify and direct people to the exact next step and so instead you're marketing the entire journey the lifestyle and you are letting them figure out their pathway to that lifestyle so got milk is not telling you there's a specific discount on a specific brand of milk and you go buy it you know this week because it'll be it'll be gone next week it's telling you drink milk you figure out the steps in between but right now if you're not drinking milk drink more of it and we'll let you figure out how you want to do that and that's how I like to think of it is like Madison Avenue style mass marketing and branding is not specifically identifying where you are in the customer journey and leading you to the next step it's trying to convince you of the whole journey and it's not worried about which step you're at and which one to go to next yeah I think that's a good summary for sure it's yeah it's it's presenting the whole experience of the thing to you in all in one bite-sized little ad oftentimes or in the in the way that mass market and and branding based awareness works multiple touches you know multiple ads the whole series of ads that went into a got milk campaign over years that's the you know those are the those are the steps in the journey and they're not stepwise they're just everyone is nudging you closer and closer into you know into the customer journey wherever you fall into it whatever step you decide to start at that might be trying milk for the first time or you know deciding to make it you know make the choice to give it to your kids at their lunch or something like that yeah like a good example is Nike right Nike started off trying to sell a specific product where they got to was a place where they had hundreds of different product types of which there are hundreds of colorways per type different sizes different target audiences kids men women different countries and different lines of athletics right running basketball baseball you know whatever so there's all these it's a combinatorial explosion you cannot know what the next right step is for someone in the Nike ecosystem it's not that specific there's just too much going on so you're better off even though it might be more efficient to identify all these people and lead them to the next step like you might eke out a profit the task of doing so is so impossible that it's better to try to convince the whole public that Nike is action Nike is you know athletics than it is to try to lead them to the next step we've touched now on direct response the trap of getting caught into big branding and mass marketing too early we've touched on what that even means and we've talked about a little bit about we've discussed this on previous episodes where we talked about getting your inspo from the Taylor Swift's of the world or the Beyonce's of the world and we'll make sure to share that in the show notes so that you guys can check that episode out if you haven't because we really go in depth on to the why to not get caught there and how to pull yourself out of it but I think there's something inherently desire everything we just explained about big mass marketing campaigns it's inherently desirable to be like oh man I'm big enough that I can present the customer journey and allow people to enter as they wish that's it's inherently desirable I think to anyone who hears it and that's why it's alluring maybe a little dangerous and also for the vast majority of Indies and I would even argue some of those bigger artists that only focus on that why it can be largely ineffective but it is sexy you know it's it's cool and it's something that I think a lot of people want to get into who doesn't want to be Nike you know who doesn't want to be Disney of course you do and I think that there are certain instances where employing some of the techniques and the strategies in big brand awareness campaigns can be really valuable for an Indie if you find yourself in a position to do so so maybe we should outline what some of those are or at least our opinions of them because I have a couple examples that I think would be cool and I'm sure you do too of benchmarks I don't even think it's benchmarks but I'm curious to hear what you think about that I think it's situational more than it's benchmark based yeah I'll say it like this look at the difference between car brands and car dealerships okay if you see a car brand commercial it is about the new model and what it will what it will mean for your life right so if you have a particularly sporty SUV it's gonna show you all of the things that that will bring to your life and then it's going to just give you the name of it and tell you it's available right whereas a car dealership is going to list all of the can't miss discounts that they currently have available how long that promotions running for and for you to go and and go to that dealership today okay because the dealership cannot afford to convince you that the new CRV is hiking and being outdoorsy okay they don't have the budget for that they need to get people in the door to buy the car and I will say that that's so we're identifying right now why things like radio promo and big press campaigns are largely ineffectual for artists it's an infrastructure problem they don't have first of all the budget to run all that stuff ad infinitum they just can't afford to run it forever so it's very constrained and then to there's not enough infrastructure out there for newer artists where I can just shazam your song or I can search your name and even get the name wrong when I type it but still land up in the right place and not only land up in the right place but there'd be enough there to keep my attention and maybe I end up buying something that's all infrastructure whereas when you get to the point where when I google you and even if I get the name wrong I'm gonna get a wall of information about your group and there's gonna be stuff going on and there's a store and then there's like the newest thing on your website and there's like all these different ways to tap in that's when that artist I feel becomes eligible to do something a little bit more mass marketing you know it's all about that infrastructure it's about when I see this piece of media whether it be you know a good press write-up or I hear you on the radio and you're not identifying what the next step is for me because you can't in those mediums am I gonna find the next step for myself what's the likelihood of me finding the next step for myself and very early on most artists like it's not likely furthermore it's very expensive so there's just huge mismatch but when your budget when you're operating costs get to the point where it's like that's not that crazy to run some radio promo for a season and it fits in your marketing budget and then everything else is developed to the point where when I get that first touch from you on the radio I'm gonna quickly find out who you are and I'm gonna find my way to you that infrastructure is not there then it's not appropriate for you yet I feel yeah that's I think that's a good situational kind of position to underline because you're right and that infrastructure is not hard to get in place and here's the rub for me I think like that infrastructure is not hard to get in place right it it's not difficult to have products it's not difficult to have places where people can sign up for your email list can sign up for your text list it's not I won't say it's not difficult but it's not impossible to set yourself up you could feasibly head straight for it right it's not impossible to have a strong social media presence or at least not have social presence that makes people go to you and find a ghost town none of that is impossible or even really that difficult at the at the most base level however what is difficult is ensuring that all of that infrastructure is right and is working and really guides people through those next steps because they're not because likely your first swing at that isn't going to be the thing that's like yeah this is this is like easily encouraging people to go through a customer journey with me it's more likely that your content isn't as good as it could be even if it's there your bribes your ways to get people under your email list aren't as good as they could be even if they're there they're not compelling your products in your store might not be good if you have a store so even if you check it's not I guess I'll put it this way it's not a checkbox right it's not like okay I got the list of infrastructure yeah well not only that you also have cost on the other end of that you have infrastructure right right but that is a really good point that's like criteria number one I think in my mind and something that I've seen play out in a situational sort of spot for a number of artists that I've worked with has been sometimes it's appropriate to move into mass marketing branding type of advertising campaigns when you have virality and that's you know very situational because it it doesn't catapult you into doing that forever it's kind of like capturing a moment in time and the 502s were a really good example of this when just a little while went viral on tik-tok a few years ago now that opened up a you know a situational singular moment in time where it was like okay it makes sense to put gasoline on the fire here and really go after this heart a similar thing happened with small town Titans back in 2018 or was it 2019 I think it was 2018 yeah 2018 when their Grinch video went viral for the second time actually on Facebook when it went viral it made sense for them to say okay like pour gasoline on this and make it continue as opposed to relying on you know the spark of virality to continue it was like all right let's just put more money on top of the funnel here and not really think about it granted there was other infrastructure going on like you were saying there was infrastructure in the back end to allow for all of that to be supported but even if there wasn't it would have been a situation where it made sense to do that yeah yeah another way to think about it might just be to think about what is the likelihood of second-order effects from doing this what's a second-order effect it's when something that was not intended to happen does happen as a consequence of what was intended to happen okay so there are certain instances where the likelihood of second-order effects locally acutely jumps up and then it will eventually go back down but what I mean to say there is that the 502s went viral on tik-tok and shortly thereafter they were on billboard they got a bunch of Spotify editorial playlists they got a bunch of nice press write-ups and their tour went well as a result and people banging down their doors to talk to them too right so these were all second-order effects of the initial action which was they went viral on tik-tok as they put out a piece of media that did particularly well if they hadn't poured gas on that fire when it went off maybe these second-order effects wouldn't have happened yeah and so if they if you can make that jump it's like well if we just really keep our foot on the gas here like these other things might happen then it can make sense and then you have to kind of measure that against the value of these second-order effects like maybe it cost me 20 grand an additional paid marketing spend to get there does it represent a $20,000 opportunity or greater mm-hmm yeah you know I would say in their case it did but yeah like if you think about it another key component of this is like when you're ready to start doing these larger plays whether that be paid spend without a goal so like you're advertising a bunch but there's no follow-up sales action you're trying to get people to take it's all just awareness and exposure like blog PR is that right radio promotion is that there's nothing really that people can do that's gonna make you that much money as a result you're hoping for second-order effects and they're very difficult to track but just to say that if you were going to do that ideally you would have so many customers who have bought from you every year that even if you make zero new customers or zero new sales that just repeat sales from previous customers or fans in this case would carry you through so it's like okay this is going to cost a third of our annual marketing budget to run it for a year okay so we're within the realm of what you already spend and then what's the worst-case scenario this brings in zero new sales it brings in zero new revenue are we going to be okay that's all based on previous direct response action maximizing the lifetime value of a customer repeat purchases every year continuing to make sales offers to them and you can rest on your laurels when you get to a point where your your customer base is so big that it's like we don't need necessarily new customer or fresh blood in we can afford to take this leap of faith hoping that marketing the journey itself will get enough people to take the next step that's appropriate for them that will be alright and I think that as an indie artist if you're doing good direct response marketing after a year three years five years it'll be at a place where you have enough customers that you can afford to take bigger shots or you have enough incoming revenue you can afford to take those bigger shots so once the cost of doing these campaigns is not nearly as scary it's not going to bankrupt you and your existing infrastructure your existing customers your existing fan base is enough to replenish that pool when you do spend that money then you start getting really in the striking distance of what we can afford to take this shot yeah it's interesting that you bring up that because it really is that's looked looking at business risk right it's looking at like what is our business currently do and can we take this whether you look at it as a risk or whether you call it an investment or whether you call it an expense it kind of doesn't matter probably sooner call it an expense or a risk then I would call something like a big branding awareness campaign an investment because well likely isn't directly tied to any kind of revenue outside of the second-order kind of effects that it might have and I'm so glad that you brought second-order effects up because I want to mention here Cirque defined second-order effects I think a lot of artists who are in the frame of thinking of marketing as only big you know Madison Ave brand awareness type stuff they think of the second-order effects as the goal of those kind of marketing campaigns and the reality is is they are not the goal yeah it can't be because you don't have control over them in the music industry the goal of mass marketing campaigns is hype it's to convince everyone that X thing is more popular than it actually is and the second-order effect that's being hoped for behind the scenes is that it will become as popular as you're pretending it is and what do I mean by that I mean like normally the radio plays the most requested songs the top spins what's tearing up the charts but people will pay to get on the radio even if they're not yet tearing up the charts why they want to appear as if they're tearing up the charts that's the impression that the audience gets from hearing that song on the radio is like these must be one of those people and so what you're paying for is the right to appear as if X it's truly paying to fake it till you make it or you break"}, "podcast_summary": "In this episode of the Creative Juice podcast, the main speakers, Jack McCarthy and Cirque, discuss the differences between how labels market and how independent artists (Indies) market their music. They emphasize the importance of direct response marketing for smaller artists and businesses, as opposed to big branding and mass marketing campaigns that are more appropriate for larger brands. \n\nThey explain that direct response marketing focuses on specific offers and prompting immediate action from the audience, while branding campaigns aim to build brand awareness without specific calls to action. Direct response marketing allows for precise tracking and communication with the audience, making it more efficient and cost-effective for smaller artists. They highlight the importance of having the right infrastructure in place, such as a strong online presence and effective marketing tools, before considering larger marketing campaigns. \n\nThe speakers also touch on the situational circumstances in which it may be appropriate for Indies to engage in mass marketing and branding campaigns. They mention the importance of virality and capturing the moment when it makes sense to pour resources into amplifying a successful campaign. However, they caution that such campaigns should still align with the business's current infrastructure and resources.\n\nThe overall tone of the podcast is informative and practical, providing valuable insights and considerations for independent artists looking to navigate the marketing landscape effectively.", "podcast_guest": "Jack McCarthy", "podcast_highlights": "Here are three quotes from the podcast transcript:\n\n1. \"Most small businesses when they start up they take their cues from large businesses in terms of how to grow, how to market and as it turns out that the style of promotion and marketing that very large businesses use is entirely inappropriate for a startup or a brand new business.\" - Jack McCarthy\n\n2. \"What's great about direct response is it is intended to only direct the audience to the next step, the absolute next step.
